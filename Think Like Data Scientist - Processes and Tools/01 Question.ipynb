    "    * Processed Data/Final Data. Sometimes it is helpful to store processed data files somewhere. A separate folder is the right place for them.\n",
    "    * Code. It is a good practise to create some external code for notebooks - **classes**, **functions** or **libraries**. Depending on the project, it is a good practice to have it in separate folder/folders, or even in a separate repository. \n",
    "    * Text files. Folder for text files - data description, information sources, ...\n",
    "    * Literature. General information sources should be stored somewhere too. Please follow the company policy for using information sources (articles, books, guides, company polici, ...).  \n",
